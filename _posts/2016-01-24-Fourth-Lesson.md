**Fourth Lesson**

This is the fourth lesson that I will be blogging about…

Firstly in this lesson we played a game where one side of the room was disagree and the other was agree. Our teacher would read out some statements and we needed to place ourselves where we thought it applied to us. Some of the statements were: 'I act the same in real life as I do on social media' and ‘I always see stereotypes in the media. After that we talked about what was reality and what was fantasy. We watched a Pepsi Max advert where there was a chimpanzee driving a taxi. We went through all of the fantasies. We then looked at how people use photoshop, it was really interesting to see the before and after. As one of these we watched a video of someone showing how Mc. Donalds make their burgers look on the pictures from how they actually look.

**Pros: **I really liked it when we watched the advert because it was quite funny.

**Cons:** Sometimes while I was playing the agree/disagree statements game where I stood was affected by where other people were standing.

**Improvement: **Next time I should stick with my gut and stay put. Even if other people have a different view.
