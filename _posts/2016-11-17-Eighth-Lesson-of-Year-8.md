**Eighth Lesson of Year 8**

This is the eighth lesson of year 8 that I will be blogging about.

Today was a really productive as everyone in the classroom was focused. The atmosphere was one of a mature class with everyone's best interests in mind. I donâ€™t think I have to explain the finished product of this lesson as it is staring you in the face but I will describe the changes that I made. Firstly, I managed to change the background from a solid purple colour to a jpeg image of a blueprint. This was surprisingly tricky as I learned that so much as a misplaced colon can break it. However after all that I think it made a large, positive effect. Secondly, due to the new, bright blue background I needed to change the other fonts on the website. This took a while but was reasonably pleasing at the end. I used the HTML Colour Picker on the W3Schools website ( [http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp](http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp) ) to find the perfect contrast. 

**Pros:** I was really productive in making my blog the best it could be

**Cons: **The teacher was occupied whenever I came across a problem

**Improvements:** I could have persevered on my own a little more
