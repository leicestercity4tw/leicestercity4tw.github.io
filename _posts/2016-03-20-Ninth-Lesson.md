**Ninth Lesson**

This is the ninth lesson that I will be blogging aboutâ€¦

At the start of this lesson our teacher told us that we were going to be using Prezi. I was excited because I had heard it was a really good piece of software for making and sharing animated presentations. He then told us to create an account on Prezi, filling out all the required boxes. Next he showed us some amazing presentations he had made, they were great because they weren't boring like if he made it on PowerPoint. They moved around and the camera zoomed in and out loads. Finally he showed us some of the really cool features and literally told us to explore Prezi.
