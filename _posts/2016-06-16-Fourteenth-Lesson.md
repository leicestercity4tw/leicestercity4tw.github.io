**Fifteenth Lesson**

This is the fifteenth lesson that I will be blogging aboutâ€¦

This lesson was mostly made up of going through what we made for homework (a flowchart) and then taking what we had written and actually creating the game in code. Specifically, we used JavaScript in the micro:bit website. I made quite a lot of progress in this lesson as I nearly finished my game, 'Find the gaps'. I think this might have been because I was enjoying what I was creating.

**Pros:** I made a lot of progress

**Cons:** Near the end lots of us lost concentration

**Improvements:** In the middle of the lesson our teacher could have given us a small break
