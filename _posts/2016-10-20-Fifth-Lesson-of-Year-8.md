**Fifth Lesson of Year 8**

This is the fifth lesson of year 8 that I will be blogging about.

Today was another Raspberry Pi lesson. It was fun as we played around with the coding, making the computer say funny things while learning a whole new load of coding skills. The best thing about today was working with my mates and seeing our codes come to life. I have enhanced my coding command vocabulary, knowing what CLS means (clear the screen) and what the $ sign means (the person receiving the code can write the answer e.g "What's your name?"; Name$ “That’s a nice name!” END).

**Pros:** I expanded my vocabulary

**Cons:** We started talking a little too much

**Improvements:** We could have tried more to stay on task
