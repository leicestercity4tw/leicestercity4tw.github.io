    <td>In this lesson I decided to adopt a new strategy to my learning. The first thing I did was tell myself exactly what my goal was for the lesson. After all I knew it would be useful for my lesson blog. Overall it was really helpful as I could hone in on exactly what I could improve: the containers. My first instinct after last lesson was to check W3Schools for tips. This proved to be really pivotal as it gave a baseline with which I changed </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I started asking my friends for help with the problems that had started to arise, however this just led to useless chatting. I think going to the teacher may have helped as they are supposed to be the 'experts'. Overall this could have saved valuable lesson time. </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>Next time I will try not to chat as much to my friends. This never did me any good as we would just lose focus, and I would inevitably make a mistake. All this would do is set me back. Instead I think I should have stepped back and seen the easier and more obvious route. </td>
