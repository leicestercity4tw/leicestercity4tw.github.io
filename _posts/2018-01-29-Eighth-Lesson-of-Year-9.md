  <tr>
    <td>This lesson was very productive as I was able to show my good independent skills while working speedily and effectively on my code. It was very useful when the teacher gave us hints and tips to make our lives easier and when he shared us his version of the quiz I was able to amend my own work.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Again much like last lesson, I don't think anything limited my learning. However the only thing was that when the teacher posted his own code I must have been subconsciously copying his work. To try and show that this was not intentional I added my thoughts in hashed out areas and did some research of my own.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try to keep up my good positive learning momentum. This can be done by focusing on my work fully but also taking breaks and helping others so I don't get too engrossed.</td>
