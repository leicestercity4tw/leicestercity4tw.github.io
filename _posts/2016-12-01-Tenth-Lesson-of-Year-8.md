    <td>At the start of the lesson I managed to cope by myself. I realised that our teacher had created a template table that we were supposed to be using that I didn't know about. I made a copy of it and I will start using it from now on. This will make my blogs more structured. However I had to figure out a way .</td>

    <td>Near the middle of the lesson I realised that I had a problem surrounding the table. I had to make it visible on the website which is harder than you think. First of all I uploaded the blank template and saw how it looked, then I tried to work from that. It was hard to see what was working so after a while I just gave up. I started asking my friends but they wouldnâ€™t help me at all. What I should have done was visited the W3Schools website as they have an amazingly helpful area fully dedicated to CSS (the html code language we are using).</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will look on the W3Schools website before asking my friends how to do something. In the long run this will help me a lot as I will become more independant. Therefore it will be easier to learn in the future; school and beyond. </td>
