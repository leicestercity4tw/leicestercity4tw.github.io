    <td>This lesson was mainly just a recap on some of the maths involving computers that we learnt last year. So all I really had to do was listen intently.</td>

    <td>As my teacher was talking for most of the lesson I did seem to find myself losing concentration for a bit. This is really  dangerous as I will definitely need to know the important facts that my teacher tells me in the future.</td>
