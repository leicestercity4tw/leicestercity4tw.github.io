**Third Lesson of Year 8**

This is the third lesson of year 8 that I will be blogging about.

In this lesson we continued to follow the instructions stated in the booklet. We started to become slightly distracted but we managed to get back on track

**Pros:** We started to actually think deeper into what we were actually doing with our FuzeBoxes

**Cons:** We started to get a little carried away again

**Improvements:** We could have been made to show our work to the teacher
