**A Summary of Year 7**

Last year was a really productive one in IT. Here is a summary of the whole three terms.

The very start of September had us creating our blogs, this helped with our problem solving skills. This is because we had to, first, locate the problem then try to find a suitable solution for it. Then we moved onto looking at different types of social media and how they should be used properly and safely. When Christmas came around we had started our presentations on Prezi, this really helped my organisational skills as I had to manage a big project in a short time. It lasted from Christmas to the middle of January. Then after that we moved onto working with the micro:bit, which we spent a *lot* of time on. I didn't really enjoy that as it started getting quite boring. And that brought us right up to the summer holiday.
