**Peripherals, Computer Components and Computer Security**

**Peripherals:**

Peripherals are devices that are vital for all of the tasks that you may need to be accomplished. They come in two groups: inputs and outputs

**Inputs**  Microphone			Camera	Scanner

**Outputs**	Speakers or headphones	Monitor	Printer

**Computer components:**

The three main components in a computer are: hard drive, RAM (Random Access Memory) and the CPU (Central Processing Unit).

**Hard Drive:**	This component stores all of the long-term memory such as documents, pictures, music and videos. If you turn off your computer all of the information is logged on the hard disk in a series of 1s and 0s.

**RAM:**  This component stores short-term memory i.e. the website you are on. It is a lot faster than a hard drive so it is more efficient. However it has much less storage space.

**CPU:**			This is mostly called the 'brains' of the computer because it carries out the processes needed to run any software.

**Computer Security:**

The most common way of contracting a virus on your computer is through attachments on emails. They can spread really fast and take your personal information.

**Malware:		**The word 'malware' is a cross between malicious software. These are programs trying to gain access to your device. It can copy personal information or make your device really slow.

**Virus:			**A virus is a subcategory in malware. These are usually sent through attachments in emails. Viruses are almost impossible to spot, this helps them spread really quickly and efficiently.

**Worms:**		Worms are like viruses except the user doesn't need to open anything for the program to launch. They copy themselves through different computers.

**Trojan:		**A trojan virus is a facade, it makes the user believe that it is a good, useful piece of software. Lots of people download these as a result of them being tricked. After it has been downloaded it will start maliciously attacking the device.

**Zombienet/Botnet:	**These two words mean the exact same thing (just to clear that up). These things aren't actually viruses but they are computers that, without their userâ€™s consent, forward viruses and spam to other computers.
