    <td>This lesson was the third with our new teacher. I think it went really wellbecause the logic was really simple for me to understand while others took a while to wrap their heads around the question to a final answer format. Therefore I was able to answer lots of the teacher's qauestions which boosted my confidence a lot.</td>

    <td>Again much like last lesson, I don’t think anything limited my learning. It was a really quite a good lesson because I decided not to speak anyone throughout the lesson. I think they have got the mesage thatI wopuld like to take this as a serious subject as it’s a viable option for GCSE.</td>
