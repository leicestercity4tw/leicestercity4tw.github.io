**Eighteenth Lesson**

This is eighteenth lesson that I will be blogging about…

This lesson was literally just a kind of conversation in a way. All we did was talk about sexting and sex offences. Lots of the stuff that was said in the lesson was a bit unconventional and made lots of us feel uncomfortable but it was ok as even the teacher was open to recall some stories he knows. This was really helpful as it alerted us to the fact that ignorance cannot abade the law; not knowing that what what you were doing was against the law cannot save you from it. One big thing I learnt from the lesson was this:

If your friend sends you a dirty picture of him/herself through any type of social media they will be in trouble for a few things: creating, having and distributing child porn. I know that seems really bad as you break the law 3 times with one action but listen to this…

If you even just open that message you could also be prosecuted for creating (as it downloads a new copy of the image0 and having child porn even if you didn't ask for it. 

**Pros:** It was really useful that we got to talk about things in privacy

**Cons:** We weren't taking it 100% seriously throughout the lesson

**Improvements:** We probably could've taken it a bit more seriously
