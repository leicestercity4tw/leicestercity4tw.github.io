**Second Lesson**

This is the third lesson that I will be blogging about…

In this lesson we first played 'media bingo' - a game where we walked around the classroom with our bingo sheets. They said on them things like ‘this person can access the Internet whenever they want to’ and ‘this person doesn’t like to text’. We had to find a person to whom this statement applied. We then spent the rest of the lesson talking about different types of media.

**Pros: **I think it was really fun when we played the bingo because it really engaged us

**Cons: **For some of the bingo statements I may have cheated and told someone that it applied to me for the sole purpose of making them leaving. Thus making me able to tick off more of mine.

**Improvement: **If we ever play any games again I will not cheat at all!
