**Second Lesson**

This is the second lesson that I am blogging about, it will be in the same format?

In this lesson we started to dissect the components of our blog, what made it look and be like it is when it's on the internet.

**Pros: **I really started to understand what was really happening in my blog

**Cons: **Apart from momentarily forgetting my password it was a quite successful lesson

**Improvement: **Trying not to panic if I ever forget a password again!
