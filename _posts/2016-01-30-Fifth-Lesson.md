**Fifth Lesson**

This is the fifth lesson that I will be blogging about…

In this lesson we talked about the 'Pros and Cons' of social media. We came up with loads of different ideas. Some of the Pros were; It helps people to make friends and it’s largely free. One Con was; people could groom you (make you have a different perception of something for their benefit). Then our teacher showed us some of the Barclays Life Skills adverts because lots of people we saying ‘umm... ‘ and ‘like’. Not only that people’s postures were really bad making them look a lot more in control. Lastly we were given some scenarios in social media and we had to order them from the things you should never do to the things that were good.

**Pros: **I found out a lot of useful things on what is bad about social media.

**Cons:** I didn't think really deeply when our teacher asked us about social media so I didn’t think about the more subtle ones.

**Improvement: **Next time I should really think deeply when the teacher asks a question.
