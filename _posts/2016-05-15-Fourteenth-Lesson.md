**Fourteenth Lesson**

This is the fourteenth lesson that I will be blogging aboutâ€¦

This lesson consisted entirely of us testing out the micro:bit tutorials. At the beginning we started where we left off, which differed between people as some people were faster than others. In this particular lesson I didn't really learn any new skills, however we did revisit the skills that we learnt last lesson, they included:

* Using precision to minimise errors

* Detecting and correcting errors (debugging)

* Understanding the difference between if statements and else if statements - if statements are a lot less efficient as they keep asking different questions, else if makes the code cascade

* Using loops in my code

**Pros:** We had to think much more deeply into a problem if one occurred.

**Cons:** Near the end lots of us lost concentration

**Improvements:** In the middle of the lesson our teacher could have given us a small break
