    <td>This lesson was mainly set around improving the class' mentality towards failure in general. And how we can use that in school, especially when coding our blogs. We did this by watching a video about a japanese schoolchild trying to jump over a high box. It had a really deep underlying message: never give up, whatever the situation. </td>

    <td>After a while I seemed to stop taking the video seriously. This was really bad as it had a really strong message.</td>
