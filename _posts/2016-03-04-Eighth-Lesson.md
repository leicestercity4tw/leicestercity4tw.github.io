**Eighth Lesson**

This is the eighth lesson that I will be blogging aboutâ€¦

In this lesson we watched a set of videos where at the end of them there was as dilemma. The videos were about two friends who were trying to get a million views on a video. It goes way too far and ends up with a video of a boy dancing naked in the school hallways and another video of two 16 or 17 year olds having sex. These are all just to win a stupid contest. This made us realise that however big we might think a challenge is, it's not worth falling out over.

After that we discussed what we could do if that ever happened to us. Our teacher recommended CEOP to us because it is private and very helpful. They can support you in tough times.
