**Seventh Lesson of Year 8**

This is the seventh lesson of year 8 that I will be blogging about.

Today was not like the lessons we had last term as we  didn't code on the Fuze Box. In fact we didn’t even unpack them. Instead we assessed our blogs, this exact one in fact! My one wasn’t picked out to be specifically criticised but I can (and will) use some of the points to my advantage. They included: pleasing background, contrasting text colours, deep and interesting content and the amount of change to the yml and scss files. This is quite a hard topic to discuss in a blog as if I have been successful it will look good. If not then this text may not even be legible. Although I managed to gather some useful pieces of advice for my blog I did realise that after a while I was zoning out from the lesson. I think this was because the teachers ended talking for most of the hour. Therefore even though I knew that what was being said would be crucial for me to receive a good grade.

**Pros:** I managed to gather some useful pieces of advice for my blog

**Cons:** The teacher talked a little too much

**Improvements:** He could have let us try to assess each other's
