**Seventh Lesson**

This is the seventh lesson that I will be blogging about…

It was quite easy making our identity map because all of the things we needed to include were on Google Classroom.I think it was really good that people could comment anonymously because then people wrote what they really felt. Not what the person would want them to put. I think it helped me to write truthfully knowing that the person wouldn't know that it was me. I think this was the best way we could have done this, rather than having  asked questions and commented directly to the student as we sometimes do during class presentations. When someone put that there something bad about my work I didn’t try to figure out who it was (like some other people) but I thought about how I could resolve the issue. If your comment is anonymous then people may feel that they can write what they want; because they are untraceable. This helped me to think that, in the future, I should probably post more about my hobbies and less 'selfies’! I think I might also want other people on social media to know that I want to be an architect in the future because they might not have thought about that choice of career. These six lessons have really notified me that whatever I post on social media is: there for ever and is usually open. They have helped me to think about LinkedIn, which I will probably use to find work.  All in all these past six lessons have been fun and informative.
