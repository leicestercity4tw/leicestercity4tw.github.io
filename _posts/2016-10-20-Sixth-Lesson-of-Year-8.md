**Sixth Lesson of Year 8**

This is the sixth lesson of year 8 that I will be blogging about.

This lesson started unexpectedly as our monitor wasn't working with the FuzeBox. Therefore we had to use another monitor which was fine, just a bit annoying. Today I realised - the hard way - that you to have to state what a variable was before you could use it in the code. I realised this when the same error message kept coming up.

**Pros:** I expanded my knowledge

**Cons:** We started talking a little too much

**Improvements:** We could have tried more to stay on task
