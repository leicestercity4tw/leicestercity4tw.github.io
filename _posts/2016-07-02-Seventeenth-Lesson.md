**Seventeenth Lesson**

This is the seventeenth lesson that I will be blogging about…

This lesson started *really* well as we finally received our micro:bits. Even our teacher was excited for this one so he let us play around with them for the first 10 minutes of the lesson. However that wasn't the main objective of the lesson it was actually centered around internet safety and security. For most of the lesson we just discussed these topics and ended up with a full whiteboard of suggestions surrounding the internet. The board looked a bit like this…

But it obviously had lots more suggestions from the whole class but I couldn't remember everything. 

This lesson we got some homework, it was to read two news articles; one on sexting and one on revenge porn. Here they are…

I found both of the websites on the BBC website

**Pros:** It was really useful that we got to talk about things on the internet in privacy

**Cons:** We were very excited at the start when we got our micro:bits but some people couldn't concentrate after

**Improvements:** We probably could've taken a small break then carried on
