**Thirteenth Lesson**

This is the thirteenth lesson that I will be blogging aboutâ€¦

The beginning of this lesson included our teacher showing us a handy booklet about the Javascript code in the micro:bit. It had 6 step-by-step tutorials to making simple, but effective, games. We were then tasked to literally try to finish as many of them as we can. During this lesson I think I built up my confidence in:

* Using precision to minimise errors

* Detecting and correcting errors (debugging)

* Understanding the difference between if statements and else if statements - if statements are a lot less efficient as they keep asking different questions, else if makes the code cascade

* Using loops in my code

All of these things will really help me later in the term as I face much harder problems to tackle.

**Pros:** We had to think much more deeply into a problem if one occurred.

**Cons:** We had to create all of the games, even if they were really easy.

**Improvements:** We should have been able to choose which game to start on, and if it was too hard move back to one of the less complicated ones.
