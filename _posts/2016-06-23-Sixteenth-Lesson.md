**Sixteenth Lesson**

This is the sixteenth lesson that I will be blogging aboutâ€¦

This lesson was mostly made up of checking our github blogs and furthering our games on the micro:bit. It was quite fun but also quite hard as I had to think very logically.

**Pros:** I made a lot of progress as however I did have a bit of help from my teacher

**Cons:** When I couldn't do it I got a bit angry at myself

**Improvements:** I probably could've taken a small break then carried on
