**Tenth Lesson**

This is the tenth lesson that I will be blogging about…

During this lesson we shared our thoughts about Prezi. Then our teacher picked a random one presentation that one of our class had made. We went through it and he highlighted some areas that were good, and some that were not so good. Next he showed us a Prezi that he loved, we soon understood why. It was full of quite humorous mistakes that were silly and showed huge levels of laziness. Sir then asked us to comment on his post on Google Classroom three things that we should keep in mind when editing our Prezis (which was the homework). Here is what the advice looked like…

Write in your own words

Space out large blocks of text.

Not too many colours

Capital letters, full stops and have the writing written in your own words.

Try to use bullet points

No block text, bullet points and same size text

Capital letters

More colour

**Pros:** We were able to share ideas.

**Cons:** Our teacher had to go quite fast to get through the whole presentation.

**Improvements:** He could have spent some more time going through the Prezis.
