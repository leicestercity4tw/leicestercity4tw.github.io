**First Lesson**

This is the first lesson that I am going to write a blog about. I will be doing this once a week for all of my IT lessons. This is how I will be doing them;

In this lesson we created our own blog and started to personalise them.

**Pros: **I really enjoying creating a blog, it was great seeing my ideas really coming to life

**Cons: **It was quite hard to start with because I didn't properly understand what our teacher was saying

**Improvements: **Next I think more about what I am actually doing, not just copy our teacher
