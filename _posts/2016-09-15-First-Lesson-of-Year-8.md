**First Lesson of Year 8**

This is the first lesson of year 8 that I will be blogging about.

In this lesson we started using the Raspberry Pi computers. My partner and I tried out a code which was called 'Hello World'. We read what to do in a handbook and followed it step by step. This meant it wasnâ€™t very fun and near the end it even got a bit boring. However it was cool to see our creations come to life on the screen before our eyes.

**Pros:** It was cool to see our code working

**Cons:** We started to get a little bored

**Improvements:** We could have been made to work some things out
