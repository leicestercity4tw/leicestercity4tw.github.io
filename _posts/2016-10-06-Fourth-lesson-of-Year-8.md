**Fourth Lesson of Year 8**

This is the fourth lesson of year 8 that I will be blogging about.

For the third time in a row we were completing the codes stated in the booklet. However this lesson started with a mini catastrophe; when we switched our raspberry pi on the monitor's colours seemed to be inverted. But, my partner and I managed to fix the problem by getting another computer. When we actually got to it I felt like we were really productive and got a lot done.

**Pros:** We finished almost the whole booklet and really understood it

**Cons: **We didn't get the full 1 hour of the lesson

**Improvements:** We could have just moved without our teacher having to prompt us
