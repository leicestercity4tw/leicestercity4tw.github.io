**Sixth Lesson**

This is the sixth lesson that I will be blogging aboutâ€¦

In this lesson we ventured further into the mind-blowing subject of internet safety.We talked about at length how even adults will be stereotyped because of their social media profiles. Then we watched a video about what people do on Twitter. It was very funny and really annoying.

**Pros: **I was forced to think much deeper about social media.

**Cons:** We kept having watch and rewatch a really annoying video.

**Improvement: **Next time we watch a video, I will try to take notes.
