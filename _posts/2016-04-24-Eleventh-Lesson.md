**Eleventh Lesson**

This is the eleventh lesson that I will be blogging about…

At the start of this lesson our teacher said we would be experimenting with the micro:bit. I was excited because I knew a bit about it, but I also knew that they were really late in coming out. Every year 7 & 8 was supposed to have on by the start of the year, now it is the summer term! So I asked…

*"I thought these micro:bits hadn't been given to the schools yet, how will we be experimenting with them if they are still in a warehouse in the BBC?"*

He told me that there is a website ([www.microbit.co.uk](http://www.microbit.co.uk)) made by the BBC where you can program a hypothetical micro:bit. They have also added a diagram of it next to the code so you can see what happens when you try out different things. 

Next he literally told us to just play with it for 45 minutes, and we did! I learnt that there are 4 different types of code that you can use, 3 of them have step-by-step tutorials to make simple games. The first one 'Javascript' looked quite like Scratch which we had already explored in the first term. So I went with that one and followed one of the tutorials. It is really good because when you are following a tutorial it has a checklist of things to do to make the game successful, also it shows when you have done something wrong.

**Pros:** We were able to just try out anything that came to mind.

**Cons:** We only had time to explore one of the types of code.

**Improvements:** Our teacher could have told us when 15 and 30 minutes had passed so we could move onto the next type of code and notice any similarities and differences.
