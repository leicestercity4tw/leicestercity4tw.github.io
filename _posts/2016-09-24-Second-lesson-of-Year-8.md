**Second Lesson of Year 8**

This is the second lesson of year 8 that I will be blogging about.

In this lesson we continued to follow the instructions stated in the booklet. It is becoming *very* repetitive as the whole of the code was laid out before us. We started to become slightly distracted and ended up just messing about with our own code. 

**Pros:** We completed lots of other codes

**Cons:** We started to get a little carried away

**Improvements:** We could have been made to work some things out
