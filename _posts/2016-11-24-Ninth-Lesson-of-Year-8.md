**Ninth Lesson of Year 8**

This is the ninth lesson of year 8 that I will be blogging about.

Today's lesson was split into two distinct parts. I think I learnt a lot from both sections so I will discuss both in depth.

Firstly, my partner and I got out the Fuse Boxes for the first time in 3 or so weeks. However this time we challenged ourselves by making a game from scratch. This was quite a stretch but we managed it. A simple game using maths was the outcome of the first 30 minutes of the lesson. 

Secondly, we were given the opportunity to ask our teacher any questions we had surrounding our blogs. I managed to polish up my blog which really helped.

**Pros:** The teacher was never occupied whenever I came across a problem

**Cons:** At one point I got really careless and I accidently deleted some code 

**Improvements:** I could have showed more concentration near the end of the lesson
